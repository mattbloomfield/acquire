      <h1>How to Play Acquire</h1>
      <p>
        Because Acquire is not as popular or well-known a game as, say,
        Monopoly, we have included here the rules of the game. The following is
        a picture illustrating the layout of the board:
      </p>
      <p>
        The main object of Acquire is to become the wealthiest player by the end
        of the game.&nbsp; This is done by forming hotel chains, shrewdly buying
        the right stock at the right time, merging chains to obtain capital and
        adding hotels to the chains in which you have controlling interest to
        increase their value.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the beginning of the game, each player receives $6,000. To determine
        who plays first, each player draws one tile (representing a hotel) and
        places it in its matching square on the board.&nbsp; (No chains are
        formed at this time.)&nbsp; The player who has drawn the lowest
        number-letter combination starts play.&nbsp; Each player draws six
        hotels from the central cluster of face-down tiles on the table and
        keeps them in his/her &quot;hand&quot;, not allowing other players to
        see them.
      </p>

      <p>Each player’s turn consists of:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Placing one of his hotel tiles on its matching square on the board</b
            >.&nbsp; If this hotel creates a chain or causes a merger, all
            transactions connected with
            <i><a href="#creating" >Creating Chains</a></i> or
            <i><a href="#merging" >Merging Chains</a></i> are completed
            before the player’s turn continues.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Buying Stock</b>.&nbsp; If, after placing his hotel, there
        are one or more hotel chains on the board, the player may, if he wishes,
        buy stock in one or more of them.&nbsp; (See
        <i><a href="#buying">Buying Stock</a></i
        >).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Drawing another hotel tile to replace the one played.</b>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <hr />
      <p>
        <h2><a name="creating">CREATING NEW CHAINS</a></h2>
      </p>
      <p>
        When a player places a hotel tile next to one already on the board (rank
        or file—<i>not diagonally</i>), a chain is created.&nbsp; For example,
        hotel tiles <b>A1</b> and <b>B2</b> are on the board but
        <i>do not form a chain </i>as they adjoin diagonally (not rank or
        file).&nbsp; Assume that among his six hotels, a player has
        <b>C2</b>
        and <b>B1</b>.&nbsp; He places <b>C2</b>, creating a two-hotel
        chain.&nbsp; (If he had placed <b>B1</b>, he would have created a
        three-hotel chain; see above diagram.)&nbsp; Then assume that, on his
        next turn, he places <b>B1</b>, expanding the chain to four hotels.
      </p>
      <p>
        The maker of a chain chooses its name from seven possible chains, taking
        the appropriate chain marker and placing it atop any one hotel in the
        chain.&nbsp; He then receives a &quot;Founder’s Bonus&quot; of one free
        stock in that chain.&nbsp; A maximum of seven chains may be on the board
        at one time.&nbsp; Any hotel which would create an eighth chain may not
        be placed.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        <h2><a name="merging">MERGING CHAINS</a></h2>
      </p>
      <p>
        When a player places a hotel adjacent to two (or more) chains, a merger
        takes place.&nbsp; The chain with more member hotels takes over the
        other(s).&nbsp; If the chains are the same size before the merging hotel
        was placed, the person who made the merger chooses which chain takes
        over.&nbsp; The chain marker of the now defunct chain is removed.&nbsp;
        (See below, at <i><a href="#multiple">Multiple Mergers</a></i
        >, for what to do when placing one hotel that merges more than one
        chain).
      </p>
      <p>
        A chain containing 11 or more hotels is &quot;safe&quot; and cannot be
        taken over by another chain.&nbsp; A player may not place a hotel which
        would merge two safe chains.&nbsp; A safe chain may still take over an
        open chain, however.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>MAJORITY HOLDER'S BONUS</h3>
        At merger time, bonuses are paid
        to the two largest shareholders in the defunct chain.&nbsp; In the case
        of a tie for the title of largest shareholder, the first and second
        bonuses are combined and divided equally between the tying
        shareholders.&nbsp; In the case of a tie for the title of second largest
        shareholder, the second bonus is divided equally between the tying
        players.&nbsp; If only one player holds stock in the defunct chain, he
        receives both bonuses.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>DISPOSAL OF STOCK AT TIME OF MERGER</h3>
        After the bonuses have
        been paid, each player,
        <i>starting with the merger maker and continuing clockwise</i>, handles
        his/her stock in the defunct chain in one or more of the following ways:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Hold</b>:&nbsp; Stock may be held in expectation of starting
          another chain with that name.</li>
        <li><b>Sell</b>:&nbsp; Stock may be sold to Stock Market at a price
          determined by the number of hotels in the defunct chain before the
          merger.</li>
        <li><b>Trade</b>:&nbsp; Stock may be traded at the rate of two
          blocks of defunct stock for one block of controlling chain stock.&nbsp;
          (If the Stock Market has no remaining blocks of controlling chain stock,
          players may not trade).</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        <h3><a name="multiple">MULTIPLE MERGERS</a></h3>
        When multiple mergers (mergers of more than two chains at once)
        occur, the larger chain takes over all smaller chains
        <i>simultaneously</i>.&nbsp; The multiple merger is then handled as
        individual mergers.&nbsp; Majority holder’s bonuses are paid for
        <i>the larger of defunct chains </i>and players dispose of their stock
        in this chain.&nbsp; Then <i>the smaller defunct chain </i> is handled
        in the same manner.&nbsp; In the case of a tie, the merger maker chooses
        which defunct chain is to be handled first.&nbsp; Bonuses and stock
        prices are determined by the number of hotels in the defunct chain
        before the merger.<br />
      </p>

      <hr />
      <p>
        <h2><a name="buying">BUYING STOCK</a></h2>
      </p>
      <p>
        Any player, immediately after playing his hotel, may buy stock in any
        active chain—up to a maximum of three blocks in any one turn.&nbsp; If
        he is unable to place any of his hotels, he may still buy stock.&nbsp;
        His purchase may be in one, two or three different chains.&nbsp; Price
        per block varies with the number of hotels in the chain.
      </p>
      <p>
        A player who runs out of money cannot buy stock but <i>must</i> place a
        hotel if he is able.&nbsp; He cannot raise money by selling stock except
        during the designated disposal period after a merger.&nbsp; Trading and
        selling of stock between players is not permitted.&nbsp; At any time,
        player may ask how much stock remains in a particular chain.<br />
        &nbsp;
      </p>

      <hr />
      <p>
        <h2><a name="ending">ENDING THE GAME</a></h2>
      </p>
      <p>
        The game ends when one player, during his turn, announces that either
        all chains on board are &quot;safe&quot; or that any one chain contains
        41 or more hotels.&nbsp; A player does not have to announce that the
        game is over if it is to his advantage to continue playing.&nbsp; After
        announcing that the game is over, the player may still complete his
        turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        To determine the winner, all chains are bought out by the bank.&nbsp;
        Majority holder’s bonuses are paid for all active chains.&nbsp; All
        players sell their stock.&nbsp; Stock in a chain that is not on the
        board is worthless.&nbsp; The player with the most money is the winner.
